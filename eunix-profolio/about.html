    <h1>♡About Me♡</h1>
    <h2 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    Hello, and welcome to my little corner of the internet ♡
    </h2>
 <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
  My name is Evie, and this website is a reflection of who I am—soft thoughts, quiet creativity, and gentle growth. I enjoy creating things that feel warm, calm, and meaningful, whether it’s through design, writing, or learning something new.
  I’m someone who appreciates the small details in life: pastel colors, handwritten notes, soft music playing in the background, and moments of peaceful focus. 
 </p>

 <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    These little things inspire me to create a space that feels inviting and comforting—a place where I can share my interests and projects with others who might appreciate the same gentle aesthetic.
 </p>

 <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    I’m passionate about learning and self-improvement, but I also value taking things slow and savoring the journey. Life can be hectic, and I believe in the importance of finding balance and tranquility amidst the busyness.
 </p>

 <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
 I believe that beauty doesn’t have to be loud—it can exist in simplicity, kindness, and sincerity. That’s the feeling I wanted to share through this website.
 As a student, I’m constantly learning and improving myself, both academically and personally. I enjoy studying, especially when I can do it in a calm and cozy environment. 
 </p>

 <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    Whether it’s reading a good book, practicing new skills, or exploring different subjects, I find joy in the process of growth and discovery.
 </p>

 <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    In my free time, I love indulging in soft aesthetics—collecting cute stationery, decorating my study space with pastel colors, and curating a playlist of soothing music to accompany my work.
 </p>

 <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
  I also like exploring creative hobbies such as designing simple websites, organizing ideas, and expressing myself through visuals and words.
  This website was created not only as a project, but as a personal space—somewhere I can grow, experiment, and gently express who I am. Thank you for being here and taking the time to learn a little about me ♡
  I hope this space feels soft, welcoming, and inspiring to you.
 </p>

 <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    Thank you for visiting my website. I hope you find something here that resonates with you and brings a bit of calm and joy to your day. ;w;
