      <h2>Daily Routine</h2>
      <p>
        My school day usually starts with reviewing my notes and preparing my
        materials. I enjoy planning my tasks digitally to stay organized and
        focused throughout the day.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
        After classes, I take time to rest before working on homework, computer
        projects, and creative digital designs in the evening.
